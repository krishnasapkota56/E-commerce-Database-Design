# E-commerce-Database-Design
The database plays a crucial role in any dynamic system, especially in an E-commerce setup where various components like user management, product listings, and order processing need to seamlessly interact. To ensure smooth operations, a reliable Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is essential. For this project, I opted for MySQL due to its versatility and widespread use.

 My aim was to design a practical database system that could effectively support an E-commerce platform. Throughout the project, I focused on simplifying complex concepts and bridging theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.
